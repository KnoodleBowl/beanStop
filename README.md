 Portfolio website about an imaginary coffee shop. The name of the shop is Bean Stop. 
 Busting with activities with their world famous black coffee, iced espresso, and cappuccino. 
 The owner wants a website to display customer's favorites and provide a platform to reward points to customers. He wants it to
