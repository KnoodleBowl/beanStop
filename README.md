# beanStop
 Portfolio website about an imaginary coffee shop. The name of the shop is Bean Stop. Single-page website.
 Busting with activities with their world famous black coffee, iced espresso, and cappuccino. 
 The owner wants a website to display customer's favorites and provide a platform to reward points to customers. He wants it to 
 be user-friendly to mobile and pc users. 
 I am referencing to popular coffee shops, for example Starbucks, to make this website. 
I use HTML5, CSS3, and bootstrap(linked in head).
